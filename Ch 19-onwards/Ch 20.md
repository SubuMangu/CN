## Internetworking
- The physical and data link layers of a network operate locally(in a locality).
- The physical and data link layers handle local delivery within a single link, but higher-layer protocols like the network layer are needed for routing across multiple links in an internetwork.

 **Need for Network Layer**
 - To solve the problem of delivery through several links, the network layer (or the inter
network layer, as it is sometimes called) was designed.
-  The network layer is responsible
 for host-to-host delivery and for routing the packets through the routers or switches.
 - The header of the packet contains, among other
 information, the logical addresses of the source and destination. 
 - The network layer is
 responsible for checking its routing table to find the routing information (such as the
 outgoing interface ofthe packet orthe physical address of the next node)
 - If the packet
 is too large, the packet is fragmented 
 -  The network layer at the switch or router is responsible for routing the packet.
 - When a packet arrives, the router or switch consults its routing table and finds the interface from which the packet must be sent.
 - The packet, after some changes in the header, with the routing information is passed to the data link layer again. 
 - The packet, after some changes in the header, with the routing infonnation is passed to the data link layer again.

 ## Interneta as Datagram Network
 - The Internet uses the datagram approach for packet switching, where each packet is treated independently and routed separately from source to destination.
 - Unlike virtual circuit switching, there is no established path between sender and receiver, and each packet may take a different route based on current network conditions, using universal network layer addresses for routing.
