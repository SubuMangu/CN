## IPv4 Adresses
- An IPv4 address is a 32-bit address that uniquely and universally defines the connection
 of a device (for example, a computer or a router) to the Internet.
-  IPv4 addresses are unique and universal.
- **Address Space:** IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses, which means that the address space is 232 or
 4,294,967,296 (more than 4 billion). 
- **Notations**: Binary and dotted decimal
## Classful Adressing
- In classful addressing, the address space is divided into five classes: A, B, C, D,
 and E.

-  Class A addresses were designed for
 large organizations with a large number of attached hosts or routers.
- Class B addresses
 were designed for midsize organizations with tens of thousands of attached hosts or
 routers.
- Class C addresses were designed for small organizations with a small number of
 attached hosts or routers.
- Class D addresses were designed for multicasting as we will see in
 a later chapter.
-  class E
 addresses were reserved for future use; only a few were used, resulting in anotherwaste
 of addresses
- NetID(Network I D) and HostID
-  classes D and E have no netID and HostId

**Disadvantages of class full addressing**
-  In c1assful addressing, a large part of the available addresses were wasted.
- **Address Depletion:**Even the number of devices was significantly lesser than the number of ip addresses,still we see depletion of available addresses.We have run out of class A and B addresses, and  a class C block is too small for most midsize organizations. 
-  a class C block is too small for most midsize organizations. 

**Mask**
- The mask can help us to find the netid and the hostid.
- slash notation or Classless
 Interdomain Routing (CIDR) notation.

**Subnetting**
-  If an organization was
 granted alarge block in class A or B, it could divide the addresses into several contiguous
 groups and assign each group to smaller networks (called subnets) or, in rare cases,
 share part ofthe addresses with neighbors. 
- Subnetting increases the number of Is in the
 mask, as we will see later when we discuss classless addressing

**Supernetting**
-  The time came when most ofthe class A and class B addresses were depleted; however,
 there was still a huge demand for midsize blocks. 
- The size of a class C block with a
 maximum number of 256 addresses did not satisfy the needs of most organizations.
- In supernetting, an organization can combine several class C blocks to create a larger
 range of addresses. 
 - In other words, several networks are combined to create a super
network or a supernet.
- For example, ifan
 organization is given four class C addresses, the mask changes from /24 to /22. 

## Classless addressing
-  In this scheme, there are no
 classes, but the addresses are still granted in blocks
- In classless addressing, when an entity, small or large, needs to be connected to the
 Internet, it is granted a block (range) of addresses
- Restrictions(3 restrictions)
- Mask
- Number of addresses
- Last address ,first address

**Network addressing**
- When an organiza- tion is given a block of addresses, the organization is free to allocate the addresses to the devices that need to be connected to the Internet
- The first address is called the
 network address and defines the organization network.
- the first address is the one that is used by routers to direct the message sent to the organization from the outside.

**Two level hierarcy:** Network prefix and host address.

**Three level hierarchy(Subnetting):**
 - An organization that is granted a large block of addresses may want to create clusters of
 networks (called subnets) and divide the addresses between the different subnets.
 -  All messages are sent to the router address that connects the organization
 to the rest of the Internet; the router routes the message to the appropriate subnets. The
 organization, however, needs to create small sub blocks of addresses, each assigned to
 specific subnets. 
 - Look at given example

**Address allocation**
- The ultimate responsibility of address allocation is given to a global authority called the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Addresses (ICANN). 

## Network address translation(NAT)
- NAT addresses is the shortage of IPv4 addresses due to the increasing number of home users and small businesses needing multiple IP addresses for their networks.
- To separate the addresses used inside the home or business and the ones used for the Internet, the Internet authorities have reserved three sets of addresses as private addresses
- Any organization can use an address out of this set without permission from the Internet authorities
- **Definition:** NAT (Network Address Translation) maps multiple private IP addresses to a single public IP address (or a few) to enable devices in a local network to access the internet.

 **Address Translation**
 - All the outgoing packets go through the NAT router, which replaces the source address
 in the packet with the global NAT address
 - All incoming packets also pass through the
 NAT router, which replaces the destination address in the packet (the NAT router global
 address) with the appropriate private address. 
 - Refer the diagram

**Translation Table**
- The reader may have noticed that translating the source addresses for outgoing packets
 is straightforward. But how does the NAT router know the destination address for a
 packet coming from the Internet? 
- There may be tens or hundreds of private IP addresses,
 each belonging to one specific host. The problem is solved ifthe NAT router has a translation table
- It can be done in various ways
1. **Using One IP Address(one to one)**
- In its simplest form, a translation table has only two columns:
 the private address and the external address (destination address of the packet). 
- When
 the router translates the source address of the outgoing packet, it also makes note of the
 destination address-where the packet is going. 
- When the response comes back from
 the destination, the router uses the source address of the packet (as the external address)
 to find the private address of the packet.
2.  **Using a Pool of IP Addresses(many to one)**
-  Since the NAT router has only one global address, only
 one private network host can access the same external host. To remove this restriction, the
 NAT router uses a pool of global addresses. Forexample, instead of using only one global
 address (200.24.5.8), the NAT router can use four addresses (200.24.5.8, 200.24.5.9,
 200.24.5.10, and 200.24.5.11).
3. **Using Both IP Addresses and Port Numbers(Many to many)**
- To allow a many-to-manyrelationship
 between private-network hosts and external server programs,we need more information
 in the translation table. 
- For example, suppose two hosts with addresses 172.18.3.1 and
 172.18.3.2 inside a private network need to access the HTTP server on external host  25.8.3.2.
-  Note that when the response from HTTP comes back, the combination of source
 address (25.8.3.2) and destination port number (1400) defines the-private network host
 to which the response should be directed. 

## IPv6
- Despite all short-term solutions, such as classless addressing, Dynamic Host Configu
ration Protocol (DHCP), discussed in Chapter 21, and NAT, address depletion is still a
 long-term problem for the Internet. 
- This and other problems in the IP protocol itself  such as lack of accommodation for real-time audio and video transmission, and encryp
tion and authentication of data for some applications, have been the motivation for IPv6.
