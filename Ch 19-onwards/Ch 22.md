## Delivery
- **Delivery:** Ensuring packets are delivered to the correct recipient.
-  The delivery of a packet to its final destination is accomplished by using two different
 methods of delivery, direct and indirect

1. **Direct Delivery:**
- Occurs when the source and destination are on the same physical network.
- Uses ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) to find the MAC address of the recipient.

2. **Indirect delivery**
- Happens when the source and destination are on different networks.
- Packets pass through routers for delivery.

## Forwarding
- **Definition:** Deciding which path to send a packet toward its destination.
-  Forwarding requires a host or a router to have a routing table to find the route to final destination.
- More number of entries in the routing table leads to inefficiency.

### Forwarding techniques
1. **Next-Hop Forwarding** 
- Routing table only stores the address of next hop, not the entire path.
2. **Route Forwarding**
- Routing table stores the address of the upcoming hops.
3. **Host-Specific Forwarding:** Used for specific hosts.
4. **Network-Specific Forwarding:**
- Simplifies table by grouping all hosts under a network address.
- Here, instead of having an entry for every destination host connected to the same physical network (host-specific method), we have only one entry that defines the address of the destination network itself.
- In other words, we treat all hosts connected to the same network as one single entity. 
- For example, if 1000 hosts are attached to the same network, only one entry exists in the routing table instead of 1000. Figure 22.3 shows the concept.
5. **Default Routing:** 
- For destinations not explicitly listed in the routing table.
- Used for access to rest of the Internet

## Forwarding for classless addressing
-  In classless addressing, we need at least four colwnns in a routing table
-  In classless addressing, the routing table needs to have one row of information for each block involved. 
- The table needs to be searched based on the network
 address (first address in the block).
 - Unfortunately, the destination address in the packet
 gives no clue about the network address.
 - To solve the problem, we need to include the
 mask (/n) in the table; we need to have an extra column that includes the mask for the
 corresponding block

**Address aggregation**
- Address aggregation (also called route summarization) is the process of combining multiple IP network routes into a single, summarized route to reduce the size of routing tables.
- Eg, If a router has routes for 192.168.1.0/24, 192.168.2.0/24, and 192.168.3.0/24, it can aggregate them into a single route 192.168.0.0/22. This improves efficiency by advertising one route instead of multiple.

**Longest mask matching**
- Longest mask matching is the process where a router selects the route with the most specific subnet mask (longest prefix) when multiple routes match a destination IP

eg;

- For a destination IP 192.168.1.5, if the routing table has:

- 192.168.1.0/24 (mask 255.255.255.0)
- 192.168.1.0/25 (mask 255.255.255.128)
- The router chooses 192.168.1.0/25 because it has the longer prefix, making it more specific.

**Routing Table**
- Static and dynamic routing table
- Format.

## Unicast routing protocols
- A unicast routing protocol is used for one-to-one communication, where data is routed from a single source to a specific destination host.
- They can be intradomain(within network) or interdomain(among networks)
-  Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is an implementation of the distance vector
 protocol. 
 - Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is an implementation ofthe link state proto
col. 
- Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is an implementation of the path vector protocol

**RIP**
- The Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is an intradomain routing protocol used
 inside an autonomous system.
 -  based on distance vector
 routing.
- considerations/rules

**LSR**
- Routers build a complete map of the network.
- Uses Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm for shortest path calculation.
- ink state packet can carry a large amount
 ofinformation. For the moment, however, we assume that itcarries a minimum amount
- **Link state knowledge** refers to a router's understanding of the entire network's topology, including the state of each link and the cost to reach neighboring routers.

**OSPF**
- The Open Shortest Path First or OSPF protocol is an intradomain routing protocol
 based on link state routing. 
- Its domain is also an autonomous system
- To handle routing efficiently and in a timely manner, OSPF divides an auto
nomous system into **areas**.
-  An area is a collection of networks, hosts, and routers all
 contained within an autonomous system. 
- An autonomous system can be divided into
 many different areas.
 - All networks inside an area must be connected.
 - At the border of an
 area, special routers called **area border routers** summarize the information about the
 area and send it to other areas. 
 - Among the areas inside an autonomous system is a spe
cial area called the **backbone**; 
- all the areas inside an autonomous system must be con
nected to the **backbone**.
-  the backbone serves as a primary area and the
 other areas as secondary areas.
 - The routers inside the backbone are called the
 **backbone routers**.
 -  . Note that a backbone router can also be an area border router.

 - **Metric:**
 - The OSPF protocol allows the administrator to assign a cost, called the metric,
 to each route. 
 - The metric can be based on a type of service (minimum delay, maximum
 throughput, and so on).
 -  As a matter offact, a router can have multiple routing tables,
 each based on a different type ofservice.
 
**Types of Links**
1.  A **point-to-point** link connects two routers without any other host or router in
 between. 
2.  A **transient link** is a network with several routers attached to it. Here, every individual router is connected to a designated router.
3.  A **stub link** is a network that is connected to only one router.
4. When the link between two routers is broken, the administration may create a
 **virtual link** between them, using a longer path that probably goes through several
 routers

**Path vector routing**
- Distance vector and link state routing are both intradomain routing protocols. They can
 be used inside an autonomous system, but notbetween autonomous systems. 
- Both of
 these routing protocols become intractable when the domain of operation becomes
 large.
 - Distance vector routing is subject to instability if there are more than a few hops
 in the domain of operation.
 -  Link state routing needs a huge amount ofresources to calculate routing tables. It also creates heavy traffic because of flooding. 
 - There is a need
 for a third routing protocol which we call path vector routing.
 -  In path vector routing,
 we assume that there is one node (there can be more, but one is enough for our concep
tual discussion) in each autonomous system that acts on behalf of the entire autonomous system called the **speaker node**. 
 - The speaker node in an AS creates a
 routing table and advertises it to speaker nodes in the neighboring ASs.
 - The idea is the
 same as for distance vector routing except that only speaker nodes in each AS can com
municate with each other.
- A speaker node
 advertises the path, not the metric of the nodes, in its autonomous system or other
 autonomous systems

**Advantages of path vector routing over DVR**
1. **Loop prevention:** It prevents looping which occurs in dvr. When a router receives a message, it
 checks to see if its autonomous system is in the path list to the destination. If it is,
 looping is involved and the message is ignored.
2. **Policy Routing:** When a router receives a message, it can check the path. Ifone of the
 autonomous systems listed in the path is against its policy, it can ignore that path
 and that destination.  It does not update its routing table with this path, and it does
 not send this message to its neighbors.
3. **Optimum path:** The optimum
 path is the path that fits the organization. For example, a path from
 AS4 to ASI can beAS4-AS3-AS2-AS1, oritcanbeAS4-AS3-ASI
