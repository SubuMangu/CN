## IEEE Standards
**Introduction of IEEE Project 802**
- Initiated in 1985 by the IEEE Computer Society to set standards for intercommunication among devices from different manufacturers.
- Focuses on the physical layer and data link layer of LAN protocols.
- Does not replace OSI or Internet models but complements them.
- **Data Link Layer Subdivision:**
Divided into two sublayers: Logical Link Control (LLC) and Media Access Control (MAC).
1. **Logical Link Control (LLC)**
- Handles flow control, error control for upper-layer protocols if required.
- all LANs under IEEE standards use the same LLC protocol, which standardizes flow and error control. This uniformity allows different types of LANs to communicate seamlessly.
2.  **Media Access Control (MAC)**
- Defines specific media access methods for each LAN protocol (e.g., CSMA/CD for Ethernet, token-passing for Token Ring).
3. **Physical Layer**
- Dependent on the type of physical media used.
- Example: Standard Ethernet has one MAC sublayer but different physical layer specifications for its implementations.

## Evolution of Ethernet standards
### 1. **Standard Ethernet(10Mbps)**
- The IEEE 802.3 Standard was first defined for 10-Mbps Ethernet with I-persistent CSMA/CD access method.
- It uses Manchester Line Encoding,because it provides good synchronisation and no dc component.
- Minimum payload length is 46 bytes because of the limitationsin csma cd as we discussed, for collision detection Transmission time must be twice of maximum propagation time.
- The maximum payload is 1500 bytes because of the historical reasons
    1.  First, memory was very expensive when Ethernet was designed: a maximum
 length restriction helped to reduce the size of the buffer.
    2.  the maximum length
 restriction prevents one station from monopolizing the shared medium, blocking other
 stations that have data to send

**Network Interface Card**
- A Network Interface Card (NIC) is a hardware component that connects a computer to a network, enabling communication with other devices.
-  Each station on an Ethernet network (such as a PC, workstation, or printer) has its own
 network interface card (NIC).
 - The NIC fits inside the station and provides the station
 with a 6-byte physical address.
**To be discussed later**
- Slot time
- Slot Time and Collision
- Slot Time and Maximum NetworkLength
- 5-4-3 rule

- lOBase5: Thick Ethernet,10Base2: Thin Ethernet Uses coaxial cable with bus topology.
- 10BaseT Uses twisted pair cable with star topology, having a central hub.It reduces the chance of collision unlike bus topology.Twisted pair cable supports duplex mode of transmission unlike coaxial cable.
- 10BaseF: Fiber Ethernet Also has star topology and each device is connected to the hub by two fibre optic cables, one for sending and the other for receiving.
- Each of these types of cable have maximum length to prevent attenuation.

**Modifications in standard Ethernet**
1. **Bridged Ethernet** 
- The LAN is divided into segments using bridges.
- **Increased Bandwidth:** Bridges allow multiple data transmissions to occur simultaneously, raising the overall network bandwidth.
- **Collision Domain Separation:** Bridges isolate collision domains, reducing network congestion and improving performance.

2.  **Switched Ethernet**
- Extends the idea of a bridged LAN by using an N-port switch, where N is the number of stations.
- Each station gets a dedicated connection to the switch.
- Divides the network into N collision domains, ensuring better performance.
3. **Full duplex Ethernet**
-  The full-duplex mode increases the capacity of each
 domain from 10 to 20 Mbps.
- **No need of CSMA/CD:**  In a full
duplex switched Ethernet, each station is connected to the switch via two separate links. Each station or switch can send and receive independently without worrying about collision.
4. **MAC Control Layer:**
- LLC is not enough because it works at a higher level, while the MAC Control Layer provides faster, low-level flow and error control needed for real-time tasks.
-  When the receiver receives the frame, it does
 not send any positive or negative acknowledgment.
- To provide for flow and error control in full-duplex switched Ethernet, a new
 sublayer, called the MAC control, is added between the LLC sublayer and the MAC
 sublayer
### 2.Fast Ethernet(100Mbps)
- the bus topologies was changed to star topology. 
- For the star topology, there are two choices, as we saw
 before: half duplex and full duplex.
-  In the half-duplex approach, the stations are con
nected via a hub; in the full-duplex approach, the connection is made via a switch with
 buffers at each port. 
- Half duplex uses csma/cd, whereas full duplex does notAuto negation

**Autonegation**
-  A new feature added to Fast Ethernet is called autonegotiation.
- Auto-negotiation in Fast Ethernet is a protocol that allows devices to automatically select the best common speed and duplex mode (10/100 Mbps, half/full-duplex) for communication.
- eg; The laptop supports 10/100/1000 Mbps speeds, while the switch supports only 10/100 Mbps.Both devices agree on the best common settings: 100 Mbps full-duplex (the highest speed and duplex mode supported by both).

**Topology**
- If there are only two
 stations, they can be connected point-to-point. 
-  Three or more stations need to be con
nected in a star topology with a hub or a switch at the center, as shown in Figure 13.19.

**Implementation**
- Fast Ethernet implementation at the physical layer can be categorized as either two-wire
 or four-wire.
- The two-wire implementation can be either category 5 UTP (lOOBase-TX)
 or fiber-optic cable (lOOBase-FX). 
-  The four-wire implementation is designed only
 for category 3 UTP (l00Base-T4).


**Encoding**
- Manchester encoding needs a 200-Mbaud bandwidth for a data rate of 100 Mbps, which
 makes it unsuitable for a medium such as twisted-pair cable for bandwidth requirement.
- Hence, we have to reduce bandwidth requirement per data

1. **100BaseTX**
- uses two pairs oftwisted-pair cable (either category 5 UTP or STP).
-  MLT-3 scheme was selected since it has less bandwidth requirement
-  since MLT-3 is not a self-synchronous line coding scheme, 4B/5B block coding is used to provide bit synchronization by preventing
 the occurrence ofa long sequence of Os and Is 
-  This creates a data rate
 of 125 Mbps, which is fed into MLT-3 for encoding.
2.  **lOOBase-FX**
-  uses two pairs of fiber-optic cables. 
-  Optical fiber can easily handle high
 bandwidth requirements by using simple encoding schemes.
- The designers of100Base-FX
 selected the NRZ-I encoding scheme (see Chapter 4) for this implementation.
- NRZ-I has a bit synchronization problem for long sequences of Os (or Is, based on the
 encoding), as we saw in Chapter 4. 
-  To overcome this problem, the designers used 4B/5B
- 100 to 125 Mbps
3. **100BaseT4**
- was
 designed to use category 3 or higher UTP.
- The implementation uses four pairs of UTP for
 transmitting 100 Mbps. 


- . Encoding/decoding in 100Base-T4 is more complicated.Reason,
-  uses category 3 UTP, each twisted-pair cannot easily handle more than
 25 Mbaud.
- Three pairs of
 UTPcategory 3, however, can handle only 75 Mbaud (25 Mbaud) each. We need to use an
 encoding scheme that converts 100 Mbps to a 75 Mbaud signal. 
 -  8B/6T satisfies this requirement.
 ### Gigabyte Ethernet(1000mbps)
 -  Almost all implementations of Gigabit Ethernet follow the full-duplex approach.
 
**Full Duplex Mode**
- In full-duplex mode, there is a central switch connected to all computers or other
 switches. 
- In this mode, each switch has buffers for each input port in which data are
 stored until they are transmitted.
 -  no collision in this mode, CSMA/CD is not used
-  Lack ofcollision implies that the max
imumlength ofthe cable is determined by the signal attenuation in the cable, not by the
 collision detection process

**Half-Duplex Mode**
-  In this case,
 a switch can be replaced by a hub, which acts as the common cable in which a collision
 might occur.
-  uses CSMAlCD.
