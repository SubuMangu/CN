## Funtionality Division of Data Link Layer
- A data link layer is divided into 2 sub layers based on their functionality:Logical link control(or Data link control) and Media access control(or Multiple access resolution)
1. **Logical link control(LLC):** It is the upper sublayer responsible for data link control activities like flow and error control.
2. **Multiple access control (MAC):** It is the lower sublayer responsible for detecting and handling collision in multiple access.

- Here we will discuss about the how the multiple access control part handles collision in a multi point network.

## Random Access
- In this protocol no nodes or stations have assigned priority in accessing the transmission medium.
- All the stations have equal rights in accessing the medium.
- Collision occurs when multiple stations transmit simultaneously, leading to data loss or modification.
- Various random access protocols used are: ALOHA(Pure Aloha,Slotted Aloha),CSMA,CSMA/CD,CSMA/CA
- **Transmission time($T_{fr}$):** Transmission time is the time taken by a station to send all bits of a data frame onto the communication medium.
- **Vulnerable Time:** Vulnerable time is the period during which a data frame is susceptible to collisions with other frames in a shared medium.

## 1. Pure ALOHA
- **No Medium sharing:** Stations transmit data without checking if the medium is idle or busy.
- **Random Transmission:** Stations transmit whenever they have data, leading to potential collisions.
- **Collisions and Retransmissions:** If a collision occurs, the station waits for a random time (backoff) before retransmitting.
- **Vulnerable Time:** $2T_{fr}$
- **Efficiency/Throughput($S$):** $S=G \times e^{-2G} $, where
- The maximum value of efficiency is 0.184(18.4%) when $G=1/2$.
-  if the data rate is 100 mbps then only 18.4 mbps is correctly transmitted which is very low.

**Algorithm of pure aloha**

- **Retransmission on collision:** A collision occurs if even one bit from one frame overlaps with another. Collided frames are destroyed and need retransmission.
- K: Number of unsuccessful attempts due to collision/ no of retransmission
- **Acknowledgments and Retransmission:** Stations rely on acknowledgments to confirm successful delivery. If no acknowledgment is received, the frame is retransmitted after a random back-off time to reduce further collisions.
- **Wait Time-out time:** It waits for twice the maximum propagation time($T_P$),from one end station to another end station for acknowledgement.
- **Back-off Mechanism:** After each collision, stations wait a random back-off time ($T_B$), which increases with the number of retransmission attempts. Binary exponential back-off is commonly used.
- Look at the problems mentioned in ppt

## 2.Slotted Aloha
- Time is divided into equal-sized slots equal to the frame transmission time $T_f$ and stations can only send data at the start of a time slot.
- The vulnerable time is reduced to $T_f$(one frame transmission time), compared to $2T_f$ in pure ALOHA.
- Collisions can still occur if multiple stations transmit at the beginning of the same time slot, but fewer collisions occur compared to pure ALOHA.
- **Throughput($S$)**:$S=G . e^{-G}$ 
- $S_{max}=0.368 \text{ at } G=1$
- Slotted ALOHA is more efficient than pure ALOHA due to reduced collisions and better utilization of the medium.

## 3.CSMA(Carrier sense multiple access)
- As the name suggests it senses the carrier before transmitting.
- The carrier can be **idle** or **busy**.
- Idle state means no visible transmission in the medium with respect to a node.
- Busy state means visible transmission in the medium with respect to node.
- Three methods
 have been devised for carrier sensing: I-persistent, nonpersistent, and p-persistent.

<img src="Images/Screenshot 2024-12-12 111043.png" width="" height="">

- The problem in 1 persistent is as the carrier is free multiple stations send their frames simultaneously without waiting for each other.
- The problem with non persistent is delay.
- In p-persistent the following steps occur after the station finds the line idle:
1. With probability $p$, the station sends its frame
2. With probability $q=1-p$,  the station waits for the beginning of the next time slot
 and checks the line again.
    - If the line is idle, it goes to step 1.
    -  If the line is busy, it acts as though a collision has occurred and uses the *back
offprocedure*
- **back offprocedure:** It is a procedure generally happens where the station waits for a random time and retransmits the frame, as we have seen in pure aloha.
- In P persistent csma back off procedure occur by just waiting for random amount of time instead of waiting for stotted time.
- Hence, we Non persistent and P persistent tackles the problem of multiple stations sending their frames simultaneously to some extent, unlike in 1 persistent.

## 4. CSMA/CD
-  Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) augments the
 CSMA algorithm to handle collision. 
-  In this method, a station monitors the medium
 after it sends a frame to see if the transmission was successful. 
- If so, the station is
 finished. If, however, there is a collision, the frame is sent again
- The station can only detect collision if it receives the jamming signal while transmitting.
- As collision occurs while transmitted ,the frame comes back to the sender as a jamming signal with the same bit rate.
- Hence. The minimum size of the frame for collision detection is $2T_P$ where $T_P$ is the maximum propagation time between two end points.
- Here no acknowledgement is used for successful transmission to prevent further delay.

- **Throughput:**
- The throughput of CSMA/CD is greater than that of pure or slotted ALOHA.
-  For I-persistent method the maximum
 throughput is around 50 percent when $G =1$. 
-  For nonpersistent method, the maximum
 throughput can go up to 90 percent when G is between 3 and 8

## 5. CSMA/CA
- To avoid collisions on wireless networks, carrier sense multiple access with collision
 avoidance (CSMA/CA) was invented.
- Here acknowledgement is used to ensure successful transmission. 
- Collisions are avoided through the use three
 strategies: the interframe space, the contention window, and acknowledgments.
1. **Interframe space(IFS):** 
- It is the extra time waited before transmitting a frame to ensure gap between frames to prevent collision.
- It also determines the priority of a station or a frame. Because if a station is assigned to a shorter IFS has higher priority.
2. **Contention window:**
- Contention window is an amount of time divided into slots.
- When the channel is busy, the device waits for a random number of time slots (chosen from the contention window) before attempting transmission again.
- The size of the contention window can vary and is usually doubled after every collision to further reduce conflicts (exponential back-off).
- The larger the contention window, the lower the probability of collisions but with potentially increased delay.
3. **Acknowlegdements**
- Acknowledgment in CSMA/CA ensures that the sender knows the data was successfully received, preventing unnecessary retransmissions and reducing the chances of collisions.
- Read the procedure part from the book  for explanation of digram below

- CSMA/CA Was mostly intended for using wireless networks
- Will discuss about this later in chapter 14.

## Controlled access
-  In controlled access, the stations consult one another to find which station has the right to send.
-  A station cannot send unless it has been authorized by other stations.
 We discussed three popular controlled-access methods: reservation, polling, and
 token passing
## 1. Reservation
-  a station needs to make a reservation before
 sending data. 
- Time is divided into intervals. In each interval,  reservation frame is sent before the data frames.
- The reservation frame is used to indicate which stations have reserved the right to send data in that interval.
- Refer the diagram in ppt and explanation in book
## 2. Polling
- Polling is a centralized access method in which a primary device (controller) manages the communication by allowing secondary devices (stations) to transmit data one at a time.
- The primary device sends a **poll** message to a station, granting it permission to send data.
- Only the polled station is allowed to transmit, preventing collisions.
- two functions used:
1. **Poll:** Here, the primary device sends poll message to the station, granting it to send data.
- If the secondary device has nothing to send it sends NAK.
- If it successfully sends the data it sends ACK
2. **Select:** 
- Select function is used whenever the primary device has something to send to the secondary devices.

## 3.Token passing
-  Inthe token-passing method, the stations in a network are organized in a logical
 ring. 
-  A special packet called a
 token circulates through the ring.
- The station holding the token can only send frame at a particular time.

## Channelization
-  Channelization is a multiple-access method in which the available bandwidth of a
 link is shared in time, frequency, or through
 code, between different stations. 
-  We
 discussed three channelization protocols: FDMA, TDMA, and CDMA.
## 1.FDMA
-  In frequency-division multiple access (FDMA), the available bandwidth is divided
 into frequency bands. 
-  Each station is allocated a band to send its data. In other words,
 each band is reserved for a specific station, and it belongs to the station all the time.
- To prevent interference between frequency bands the available bandwidth of a common channel is divided into bands are separated by **guard bands.**
## 2.TDMA
- Intime-division multiple access (TDMA), the stations share the bandwidth of the
 channel in time.
- Each station is allocated a time slot during which it can send data.
- Each station transmits its data in its assigned time slot.
## 3.CDMA(To be discussed later)
