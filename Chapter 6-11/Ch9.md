# CH9:Telephone and Cable Networks

## Telephone Network
- Telephone networks use circuit switching
- The telephone network is made of three major components:
local loops, trunks, and switching offices.
- The telephone network has several levels of
switching offices such as end offices, tandem offices, and regional offices

**Local Loops**
- It is a twisted-pair cable that con-
nects the subscriber telephone to the nearest end office or local central office.

**Trunks**
- Trunks are transmission media that handle the communication between offices through multiplexing.

**Switching Offices**
- To avoid having a permanent physical link between any two subscribers, the telephone
company has switches located in a switching office. 
- A switch connects several local
loops or trunks and allows a connection between different subscribers.
- It ensures that when someone makes a call, it is directed to the correct recipient through the appropriate communication paths.

**LATA**
- A LATA (Local Access and Transport Area) is a geographical region within which local telephone companies provide services, handling both local and some long-distance communications.

**Intra-LATA Services**
- Services offered by telephone companies inside a LATA are called Intra-LATA Services.
- The carrier that handles these services is called a local exchange carrier (LEC). 

# Dial up Modems
- Traditional telephone lines can carry frequencies between 300 and 3300 Hz, giving
them a bandwidth of 3000 Hz. 
- All this range is used for transmitting voice, where a
great deal of interference and distortion can be accepted without loss of intelligibility.
- Modem stands for modulator/demodulator.
-  A modulator creates
a bandpass analog signal from binary data.
- A demodulator recovers the binary data
from the modulated signal
- The effective bandwidth of a telephone line being used for data trans-
mission is 2400 Hz, covering the range from 600 to 3000 Hz. 

**DIGITAL SUBSCRIBER LINE**
---
- After traditional modems reached their peak data rate, telephone companies developed
another technology, DSL, to provide higher-speed access to the Internet.
- Digital sub-
scriber line (DSL) technology is one of the most promising for supporting high-speed
digital communication over the existing local loops. 

**ADSL( asymmetric DSL )**
- provides higher speed (bit rate) in the downstream direction (download speed) than in the upstream direction (upload speed).

**SDSL( symmetric DSL )**
- provides equal speed (bit rate) in both downstream direction (download speed) and upstream direction (upload speed).

**HDSL(High bit rate DSL)**
- HDSL is a technology that provides high-speed data transmission over telephone lines, primarily used for T1 and E1 connections.
- HDSL uses 2B1Q encoding which is less susceptible to attenuation

**VDSL(Very high bit rate DSL)**
- The very high-bit-rate digital subscriber line (VDSL), an alternative approach that is
similar to ADSL,provides faster data transmission over telephone lines, offering higher speeds than ADSL for short distances.
